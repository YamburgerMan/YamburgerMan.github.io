On March 10th, 2024 at approximatley 11:32PM PST, a ban was issued to YamburgerTV on Kick.com for Sexually Explicit Material. All interviews are real and the subjects identity has been hidden. 
  "Who are you?
  -My name is YamburgerTV and I'm a movie streamer on Kick.com
  "Has something like this happened before?"
  -Like have I been banned? No. I've been isued countless DMCA warnings, but never a ban
  "Do you think you went too far this time?"
  -I didn't know it was going to be that type of movie, so I don't think so
  "Did you look at the subject of the movie or the actors? One of the guys' names is Chris Cocks"
  -Okay so I saw his name was Chris Cocks. Did I see mainstream porn actors in it? Yeah okay, yeah I did. I guess I thought I was untouchable
  "What was it like being locked up? You seem different"
  -I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. You think you're untouchable until something like this happens. I experienced SEVERE movie withdrawls. I couldn't really hold a conversation without using
  Yamburger emotes. It became part of my regular language. Basically without Yamburger... I'm nothing
